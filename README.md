# Multiplayer game created with vanilla js, and websockets.
## Primary goal: the player who fills all the boxes first, wins the game.

- Note: The game is not perfect, but its playable by two players for now, which can be scaled to more players by tweaking a few lines, there may be some errors here and there, didnt focus on them, as primary focus was just getting used to websockets.
